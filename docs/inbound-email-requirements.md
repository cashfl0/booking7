# Inbound Email Tracking Implementation

## ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED: Customer Reply Tracking System

### Architecture Overview
The system would allow customers to reply to booking emails and have those replies tracked in the communication history.

### Technical Requirements

#### 1. SendGrid Inbound Parse Setup
- **DNS Configuration**: MX records pointing to SendGrid
- **Webhook URL**: `/api/emails/inbound` endpoint
- **Domain**: `ticketup.ai` with catch-all `*@ticketup.ai`

#### 2. Reply-To Email Format
- **Structure**: `{business-slug}+{booking-id}@ticketup.ai`
- **Example**: `dark-helmets+clxyz123@ticketup.ai`
- **Benefits**:
  - Identifies business from subdomain
  - Links reply to specific booking
  - Maintains professional branding

#### 3. Inbound Processing Pipeline
```
Customer Reply ‚Üí SendGrid Inbound Parse ‚Üí Webhook ‚Üí Parse Email ‚Üí Create BookingCommunication
```

#### 4. ‚úÖ Implemented Components

**API Endpoint**: `/app/api/emails/inbound/route.ts` ‚úÖ
- Receives SendGrid webhook with signature verification
- Processes form data from inbound emails
- Validates business/booking relationships
- Creates BookingCommunication records
- Handles errors and invalid scenarios

**Email Parser Service**: `/lib/email-parser.ts` ‚úÖ
- Extracts business-slug and booking-id from reply-to addresses
- Cleans quoted text and email signatures from replies
- Validates booking exists and belongs to business
- Parses SendGrid webhook payloads
- Handles attachments (ready for future use)

**Database Updates**: Already ready in schema
```prisma
BookingCommunication {
  direction: INBOUND
  channel: EMAIL
  content: "Customer reply content"
  fromAddress: "customer@email.com"
  toAddress: "business-slug+booking-id@ticketup.ai"
}
```

#### 5. SendGrid Configuration
- **Inbound Parse Settings**: Point to webhook URL
- **Signed Webhooks**: Verify authenticity
- **Spam Filtering**: Let SendGrid handle spam before forwarding

#### 6. Error Handling
- **Invalid booking ID**: Send auto-reply with support contact
- **Business not found**: Route to general support
- **Parse failures**: Log and notify admin

#### 7. Security Considerations
- **Webhook verification**: Validate SendGrid signatures
- **Rate limiting**: Prevent spam/abuse
- **Content filtering**: Basic safety checks

### Benefits
- Complete conversation history
- No lost customer communications
- Professional branded email experience
- Centralized support workflow

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS: SendGrid Configuration Required

### 1. SendGrid Inbound Parse Setup
1. **Log into SendGrid Dashboard**
2. **Navigate to**: Settings ‚Üí Inbound Parse
3. **Add New Host & URL**:
   - **Hostname**: `ticketup.ai` (or your domain)
   - **URL**: `https://yourdomain.com/api/emails/inbound`
   - **Check "POST the raw, full MIME message"** ‚úÖ

### 2. DNS Configuration (Required)
Add MX record to your domain DNS:
```
MX Record: ticketup.ai ‚Üí mx.sendgrid.net (Priority: 10)
```

### 3. Optional: Webhook Security
Add to your environment variables:
```bash
SENDGRID_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_verification_secret
```

### 4. Testing
- Send test email to: `test-business+test-booking@ticketup.ai`
- Check webhook receives POST at `/api/emails/inbound`
- Verify database creates `BookingCommunication` record

### 5. ‚úÖ Implementation Status
- ‚úÖ Outbound emails include proper reply-to addresses
- ‚úÖ Webhook endpoint ready to receive inbound emails
- ‚úÖ Email parsing and validation logic implemented
- ‚úÖ Database tracking for inbound communications
- ‚è≥ **Pending**: SendGrid Inbound Parse configuration
- ‚è≥ **Pending**: DNS MX record setup
