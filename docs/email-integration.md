# SendGrid Email Integration

## Overview
The application now includes automated email confirmation system using SendGrid for booking confirmations.

## Features
- ✅ Automated booking confirmation emails
- ✅ Professional HTML email templates
- ✅ QR code generation for check-in
- ✅ Error handling that doesn't fail bookings
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- ✅ Environment variable configuration

## Setup Instructions

### 1. SendGrid Account Setup
1. Create a SendGrid account at https://sendgrid.com
2. Get your API key from the SendGrid dashboard
3. Verify your sender email domain (recommended for production)

### 2. Environment Variables
Add these variables to your `.env` file:

```env
SENDGRID_API_KEY="your_sendgrid_api_key_here"
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL="noreply@yourdomain.com"
SENDGRID_FROM_NAME="Your Business Name"
```

### 3. Testing
- With valid SendGrid credentials: Emails will be sent automatically
- Without credentials: Booking still works, email sending is skipped silently

## Technical Implementation

### Email Service (`/lib/email.ts`)
- Singleton service for email operations
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- HTML and text email generation
- QR code integration for check-in functionality

### Integration Points
- **Booking Flow**: `/app/api/book/process-payment/route.ts`
- **Email Templates**: Generated dynamically with booking data
- **Error Handling**: Email failures don't affect booking success

### Email Content
- Booking confirmation details
- Guest information
- Session date/time information
- QR code for staff check-in
- Professional business branding

## Architecture Decisions

### Following CLAUDE.md Guidelines
- ✅ Explicit TypeScript interfaces (no `any` types)
- ✅ Proper error handling without failing critical flows
- ✅ Environment variable configuration
- ✅ Singleton service pattern

### Email Failure Handling
Email sending is designed to be non-critical:
- Booking success is independent of email delivery
- Email errors are logged but don't affect user experience
- Graceful fallback when SendGrid credentials are missing

## Future Enhancements
- Email templates for reminders and waivers
- Marketing email capabilities
- Email analytics and tracking
- SMS integration with Twilio
